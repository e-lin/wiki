For the two months that I have scarified with my spare time doing this :-)
<!--more-->

*A bit summery for main topics I’ve learned from this machine learning course:*

### supervised learning:
- linear regression
- logistic regression
- neural networks
- SVMs

### unsupervised learning:
- kmeans
- PCA
- anomaly detection

### special topics:
- recommender system
- large scale machine leaning(mapReduce, parallel computing, CUDA)

### Insight:
- bias/variance, regularization
- deciding what to do next: evaluation of leaning algorithms
- learning curves, error analysis, ceiling analysis.
