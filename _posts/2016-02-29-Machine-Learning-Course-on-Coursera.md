For the two months that I have scarified with my spare time doing this :-)
<!--more-->

*A bit summery for main topics I’ve learned from this machine learning course:*

### supervised learning:
- linear regression
- logistic regression
- neural networks
- SVMs

### unsupervised learning:
- kmeans
- PCA
- anomaly detection

### special topics:
- recommender system
- large scale machine leaning(mapReduce, parallel computing, CUDA)

### Insight:
- bias/variance, regularization
- deciding what to do next: evaluation of leaning algorithms
- learning curves, error analysis, ceiling analysis.


What's Next?
---
Next step is deciding what you would like to focus on.  Someone just gave a few that are interesting to pursue but they're by no means encompassing all that is going on in the field right now.

### 1. Computer Vision

For building vision system, whether for photos or videos.

Course:

- [CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition][R6]

What you will learn in the course:

- the state-of-art convolutional neural networks
- set up GPU instance in AWS

Follow up would be like:

- scene labeling by combining with Recurrent Neural networks such as LSTM.

### 2. Natural Language Processing

For machine translation, question and answering, sentiment analysis, etc.

Course:

- [CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing][R7]

What you will learn in the course:

- word embedding (word2vec, GLove)
- bi-directional LSTMs for translation, etc.

### 3. Deep Reinforcement Learning

- Deepmind's publication section: [Publications - Google DeepMind][R8]
- [Professor Rich Sutton's book][R9] is must go-to place to start learning RL
- and supplement it with David Silver's (prominant researcher at Google Deepmind) UCL video lectures: [Advanced Topics: RL][R10]
