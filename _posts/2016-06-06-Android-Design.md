[Mobile Screen Archetypes][R2]
---
In mobile application development, mobile apps tend to adhere to a set of standard screen "archetypes" that appear again and again. There are over a dozen screen archetypes but there are six core archetypes that appear in nearly every app:

- Login / Register - User signs up or logs into their account
- Stream - User can scroll through important resources in a list
- Detail - User can view the specifics of a particular resource
- Creation - User can create a new resource
- Profile - User can view their identity and stats
- Settings - User can configure app options

Check out more examples of mobile screens on [mobile app patterns][R3].
